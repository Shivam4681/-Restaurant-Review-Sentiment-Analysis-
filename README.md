#### Project Description:<br>
1) Textual Data Processing Data Collection:<br>
   • Cleaned the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words.<br>

   
2) TFIDF Vectorization:<br>
   • Used the TFIDF Vectorizer to transform the textual data into numerical features.<br>
   • This step converts the text data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.<br>
   • Applied dropout and batch normalization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.<br>

3) Model Training and Evaluation:<br>
   • Trained the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.<br>
   • Achieved high accuracy in digit classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for image classification tasks.<br>
   • Built a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Keras.<br>



#### Repository Contents<br>
• notebooks: Google Colab notebooks with detailed steps for data preprocessing, deep learning model development, training, and evaluation.<br>
• models: Saved model files for reuse and inference.<br>
• reports: Performance metrics and evaluation reports.<br>
