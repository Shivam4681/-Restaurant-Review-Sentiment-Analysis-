#### Project Description:<br>
1) Textual Data Processing Data Collection:<br>
   • Cleaned the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words.<br>

   
2) Model Development Neural Network Architecture:<br>
   • Developed a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Keras.<br>
   • The model consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers with activation functions, and an output layer for binary classification.<br>
   • Compiled the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, which are suitable for binary classification tasks.<br>

3) Model Training Data Splitting:<br>
   • Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.<br>
   • Training: Trained the ANN model on the training data, adjusting the weights and biases through multiple epochs to minimize the loss and improve accuracy.<br>
   • Evaluation: Evaluated the model on the testing set, measuring accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable performance.<br>



#### Repository Contents<br>
• notebooks: Google Colab notebooks with detailed steps for data preprocessing, deep learning model development, training, and evaluation.<br>
• models: Saved model files for reuse and inference.<br>
• reports: Performance metrics and evaluation reports.<br>
